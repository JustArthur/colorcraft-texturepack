# 🎨 ColorCraft — Bring Color to Your Interface

**ColorCraft** redefines how you see Minecraft’s UI — literally.  
It enhances text visibility and adds rich formatting to menus, messages, and UI elements across multiple languages and mods.  
Better contrast, better clarity, better *vibes*. 🌈

---

## ✨ What It Does

Tired of dull, unreadable menus or chat text blending into the background?  
ColorCraft injects vibrant colors and styles into Minecraft’s interface — making it more intuitive and eye-catching without altering the game’s vanilla spirit.

✅ Improved contrast on menus and buttons  
✅ Styled text for game modes, tooltips, effects, and more  
✅ Support for mods & multiple languages 
✅ Seamless integration with existing UI packs

## 🧠 Compatibility Notes

- Works with (maybe) any Minecraft version
- Compatible with all major mod loaders (Fabric, Forge, etc.)
- Can be used alongside other **UI enhancement** or **dark mode** packs
- Designed for **vanilla readability** — no texture changes outside of text
- Some of the UI Texture Pack features may conflict with other UI packs, so make sure to place ColorCraft above them in the resource pack list for best results.

---
